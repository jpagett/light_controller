# light_controller

Controller for the Luminoodle Professional Bias Lighting strip. Could easily be modified to work as controller for any RF remote, or with a bit more modification, for any IR remote.

Uses an Arduino and a 433MHz transmitter. In order to clone the codes from a different remote, you will need a 433MHz receiver.
